# NLP CLI Server

A Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) server for performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This project is designed to provide efficient and scalable NLP functionalities that can be accessed via a CLI.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Text Analysis**: Sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and keyword extraction.
- **Custom Models**: Support for integrating pre-trained or custom NLP models.
- **Scalability**: Built for handling large datasets and multiple processing tasks.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anilkumartk/nlp-cli-server.git
   cd nlp-cli-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the CLI server with:
```bash
python cli_server.py
```

You can pass commands to the CLI for various NLP tasks:
```bash
python cli_server.py --task sentiment-analysis --input "This is a great project!"
```

## Available Tasks

- `tokenize`: Tokenizes the input text.
- `remove-stopwords`: Removes stopwords from the input text.
- `stem`: Performs stemming on the input text.
- `lemmatize`: Performs lemmatization on the input text.
- `sentiment-analysis`: Analyzes the sentiment of the input text.
- `ner`: Extracts named entities from the input text.
